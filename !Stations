# If you are using AUN mode with LEARN & STRICT turned on, these entries should
# be considered 'override' entries.  Use them to specify non-default ip or ports.
# If any of the above are turned off, then each and every macine you wish to communicate
# with should be listed below, and all systems need this file to be the same.
#
# Format of data lines is:
# net stn ip port
#
# Lines without exactly four parameters seperated by spaces will be ignored.

# Change from V4.11 - only the specified address is bound to.  i.e. if you specify
# the locahost address 127.0.0.1 you will not be able to connect from any other
# IP.  (This is probably best regarded as a bugfix!)  You can therefore specify
# multiple instances of BeebEm on the same port number, but only as long as each 
# has its own IP address.  
# (See Local Area connection>Properties>General>Internet Protocol>Properties>
# Advanced>Add to add more IP addresses to a Windows pc. ifconfig alias on linux/unix)
