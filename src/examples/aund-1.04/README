aund is a program to allow a Unix system to act as an AUN or Econet
fileserver.  It supports:

* Clients from System 3 to RISC OS 3.70 (and probably later)
* Servers running Linux, NetBSD and probably others
* Connectivity by AUN (over UDP) or BeebEm emulated Econet
* Read/write operation
* Multiple virtual users (all under one Unix UID)

For general installation instructions, see the INSTALL file.  aund is
not particularly portable, and expects a BSDish or GNUish C library.
Building it on other systems is likely to be unpleasant.

aund is highly experimental and likely to have bugs.  Patches to fix
these will be gratefully received by Ben Harris <bjh21@bjh21.me.uk>.
aund has a Web site at <http://bjh21.me.uk/aund/>.

Among aund's bugs are likely to be several that make it unsafe to run
on an untrustworthy network.  In any case, the fileserver protocol it
uses has serious security flaws.  In short, keep it off the Internet.
