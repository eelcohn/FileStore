aund 1.00

  This first standalone release of aund is distantly derived from the
  version distributed as part of NetBSD "othersrc".  It has been
  heavily hacked to add support for read/write operation, BeebEm
  virtual Econet, and older clients.  It lacks many useful features
  and is full of bugs (especially memory leaks), but has nonetheless
  proved to be of real utility.
